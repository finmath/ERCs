/**
 * @title ERC-DVP PAYMENT Conditional decryption of keys, conditional to payment transfer success.
 * @dev Interface specification for a smart contract that enables secure stateless delivery-versus-payment.
 *
 * The specification consists of two interface, one
 * is implemented by a smart contract on the "asset chain"
 * (the asset contract), the other is implemented by
 * a smart contract on the "payment chain" (the payment contract).
 *
 * This is the payment contracts interface.
 *
 * The rationale is that the payment in setup with
 * two encrypted keys, the encryptedSuccessKey and the encryptedFailureKey.
 * Upon payment transfer a conditional decryption of one the encrypted keys
 * is performed.
