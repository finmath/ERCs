/**
 * @title ERC-DVP ASSET Locking of assets and conditional decryption of release keys upon payment to allow secure stateless delivery-versus-payment.
 * @dev Interface specification for a smart contract that enables secure stateless delivery-versus-payment.
 *
 * The specification consists of two interface, one
 * is implemented by a smart contract on the "asset chain"
 * (the asset contract), the other is implemented by
 * a smart contract on the "payment chain" (the payment contract).
 *
 * This is the asset contracts interface.
 *
 * The rationale is that the asset is locked with with two encrypted keys
 * or a hashes of keys associated with two different adresses (buyer/seller).
 *
 * The asset in transfered to the address of the buyer, if the
 * buyer's key is presented.
 *
 * The asset in (re-)transfered to the address of the seller, if the
 * seller's key is presented.
